# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[1]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

(3*4)+5


# In[23]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

min=200
h=min//60
m=min%60
print("Hours=",h)
print("Minutes=",m)
